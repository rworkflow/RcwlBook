# Introduction {#intro}

The bioinformatics community increasingly relies on 'workflow'
frameworks to manage large and complex biomedical data (KÃ¶ster and
Rahmann, 2012; Di Tommaso et al., 2017). One solution facilitating
portable, reproducible, and scalable workflows across a variety of
software and hardware environments is the Common Workflow Language
(CWL) (Amstutz et al., 2016). 

"The Common Workflow Language ([CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/)) is a
specification for describing analysis workflows and tools in a way
that makes them portable and scalable across a variety of software and
hardware environments, from workstations to **cluster, cloud, and high
performance computing (HPC)** environments."

The CWL has been widely adopted by large biomedical projects such as
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Weinstein et al., 2013) and Galaxy
(Afgan et al., 2018). However, as a domain-specific language, the
implementation of CWL requires a level of expertise that is often
beyond the capabilities of wet-lab researchers and even skilled data
scientists. In addition, the impact of CWL pipelines is weakened by
poor integration with downstream statistical analysis tools such as R
and Bioconductor (Huber et al., 2015; Amezquita et al., 2020). 

In this book, we introduce a _Bioconductor_ toolchain for use and
development of reproducible bioinformatics pipelines in CWL using
`Rcwl` and `RcwlPipelines`. `Rcwl` provides a familiar _R_ interface
to, and expands the scope of, CWL. 

`Rcwl` enables best practices and standardized data flow between
different tools, and promotes modularization for easy sharing of
established pipelines or critical steps. `RcwlPipelines` is a
collection of commonly used bioinformatics tools and pipeline recipes
based on `Rcwl`.`RcwlPipelines` develops a community-driven platform
for open source, open development, and open review of best-practice
CWL bioinformatics pipelines.

`Rcwl` and `RcwlPipelines` reduces the learning curve required to
apply findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)
principles to the analysis of multi-omics biological experiments, and
to promote community-wide sharing of cloud-ready bioinformatics
workflows.
